## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Though there are certain syntax and styling attributes that i'm knowledgable of, i dont't get to use them often. Some of those many syntax i got to implement includes;


```css
#mobile {
    display: none;
}

#about {
    column-count: 2;
    column-gap: 50px;
}
```
 The first one helps in hiding the element from the viewport (screen).
 The second one helps in spliting a long body of text into two columns.


### Continued development

Going forward i'll focus more on:

- How best to use and apply relative values.
- Good and efficient ways of creating responsive layouts.



### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This served as a refresher for me when i needed a quick reminder of a certain syntax that skipped my mind or new styles that the project needed that i didn't know the correct syntax for.
- [Roadmap.sh](https://www.roadmap.sh) - This is an amazing site that contains roadmaps for different software developer tracks (e.g Frontend, Backend, React, Devops, etc.). It also contains links to resources.
